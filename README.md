# Roon Integration for Discord Rich Presence
## Attention! 2022 Update
**As much as I enjoyed creating this a few years ago, I do not have time to maintain this at present. If Discord implement a better images system for RP and/or Roon improve extension integration I my revisit this. In the meantime I recommend using [this implementation](https://github.com/williamtdr/roon-discord-publish).**
## Use
At this point in time you have to install NPM and run yourself. Installer is a feature to come.
## Why are there no images?
We need Discord to allow more than 150 assets as there's a lot of album covers. If you want this feature then nag them.
